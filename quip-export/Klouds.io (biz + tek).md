# Klouds.io (biz + tek)

## This Document

This is a strategic outline for Klouds.io.  There are no other Klouds.io architecture or strategy documents, this is it.  If you can't find it here, and you think that it should be here, kindly put it here.  

## Mission

Our goal is enhance the open source software ecosystem and the value of open source development to developers by causing disruptive change in the way web applications are sold.

### Derivative work generated by pursuing our mission:

Klouds.io was intentionally chosen as a project with a great deal of high-value derivative work for the MetaDev community.  Specifically, Klouds.io will:


1. Evaluate cloud architectures & orchestration systems
2. Implement a cloud architecture at 672 Quang Trung in Ha Dong, Ha Noi
3. Provision multiple lines of Internet connectivity from multiple Internet Providers
4. Optimize the internet connectivity portfolio purchased for 672 Quang Trung
5. Test Seychelles as a location for the registration of global e-commerce businesses in the MetaDev Network
6. Test automatically allocating blockchain corporate ownership schemes
7. Form a multilingual, top-class team of cloud technicians capable of supporting other MetaDev ventures.  
8. Plan the use and allocation of the 672 Quang Trung building facilities via MetaDev.

## Strategy

* Pay developers of open source webware and middleware.
* Build a **open** **marketplace** for deployments/hosting of webware and middleware.
* Provide diverse, stable and easy to use containerization schemes.
* Provide local hosting and delivery on a global basis through partnerships with local companies
    * When appropriate hardware is lacking, we can mail local ISPs the micro-server.  We can remotely adminster this micro-server AND pay the ISP for hosting through a profit-sharing scheme.  We do NOT pay co-location costs.  That's insane.  
* Keep costs to customers low by leveraging application containerization technologies and billing by usage, instead of a fixed-capacity Virtual Machine architecture. 
* Engage Developers:
    * Paying them, of course
    * Providing them with choices in terms of how funds are distributed
        * Currency  (point is:  We pay in whatever you'd like)
            * Fiat
            * Crypto
            * ???
        * % Split
        * 



## Incorporation

Klouds.io will be incorporated in Seychelles and shares will be issued by a blockchain.  People associated with Klouds.io will not recieve salaries— except for the people that are hired by Klouds' algorithms.  Everyone else will recieve dividend payments on a monthly basis for the lifetime of the business.  

Here's the formula for dividends:

```
dividends = (income) - (expenses) - (reinvestment)
income = all revenue from all sources
expenses = connectivity + 

 
```



## Development Tools

### Philosophy

Klouds.io has only one goal when we choose work tools for the people in our workforce:  enablement.  If you are lacking an ability with your tools, please see Jacob immediately.  We'd rather spend some money than have you wait for days or weeks because your current hardware or software doesn't do what you need it to.  

### HARDWARE

* Routers (using the Cisco/Huawei/Jumpiter at the until having the alternatives - virtual router)
* Switchs (Linux on Open Hardware Switch BareMetal :D)

Klouds' hardware comes in two lineups:



**Networking**

* Overlay Network L2 over L3 is very complex, high-cost and poor performance without special hardware, so => should be consider later pharses

* How to manage data-centers geographic distributed
* Most of apps are web-apps, should we provide load-balancing base on network or geographic.
*

# **Today I was swapping technologies & refactoring**
# So **webpack** is a giant configuration nightmare. Browser auto-refresh config makes it worse. Oh god.
# When I started this project, I was using **gulp**, **webpack**, **bower** and **webpack-****loaders**.
# It took probably 10 hours to get it configured to work, and the configuration problems persisted;

# Well: **babeljs**, **duo**, just took me 1-2 hours today, and much more powerful. 
# plus I accomplished toggle components via **d3js**.
# this goes to show why being framework agnostic wins. If I had been using something like React.. 
# that would be a dirty job, if I even knew how (frameworks might keep people noob)

# babeljs gives me ES6. io.js, and koa are cool because of ---> Generators. 
# This gives me an excellent tool to cut down dev time and complexity

**
# What is next?**

/**
 
 * 1. Test if duo compiled my front-end correctly.
 * 2. User Registration Button
 * 3. App Purchase Notifies Us
 * 4. Activate the Payment Buttons (manual deployment)
 * 5. Rancher Integration ??

      misc: blockchainery, pricing, app dashboard, app config, dockerizing, marketplace, subscriptions, 
        user profiles, ux/ui/design, and much much more :)

## Payment Systems

Daniel is working on the payment system, and I have one piece of bad news for him— Stripe does not seem to support the Cayman Islands.  This means that we can use an American LLC to transmit the money to the Caymans or find another solution.  Jacob is checking out alternatives to Stripe now.


## Metal

Klouds.io will have the metal portion of its infrastructure hosted on four Dual-CPU Intel Xeon Servers 

* HCMHCM
* DA Nang


These servers could be used as private cluster for dev & lab.




## OpenSource Communities & Users

* Take a server (in Vietnam) for Mirrors the OpenSource (eg., Linux, specially the Manjaro which we also use) with the domain name eg., mirror.klouds.io <== that will help Klouds closer to the community/users and building our brand in Vietnam. (https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Manjaro_Mirrors)



## Public Clouds

Provided that all goes according to plan and we are accepted into an accelerator with the appropriate relationships, we will host onto the following public clouds:

* Google Compute Engine
* Microsoft Azure
* IBM BlueMix
* HP's Cloud, “Me too!”
* Amazon Web Services



## Our Middleware

We need to choose between:


* Rancher.io
* Apache Brooklyn
* Mesosphere

If anyone can help us to narrow this list, it's greatly appreciated.  


## Deployment

**User Space**: For User

* Enjoyable way for  launching an app.
* Consider security <== user chooses to set the password or random (show the result when completing via web and/or email).

**Dev Space**: For App Dev

* Need an easy way to re
* where is images?
* where is template?
* Do simple apps first (app need a little or no configuration, load-balancing and multiple tiers) to reduce the complexity

## Applications to be hosted

(Opensource only or any apps?)


## Backups

Docker Volumes go into virtual, managed SAN Storage. Jacob wonders if this is a good task for things like....

    1. Google cloud storage
    2. Amazon s3
    3. Microsoft's version of this
    4. IBM's version of this

**Work Space**: For Dev & User, and Klouds admin

* Klouds provides what services? How to use it?
* Dev provices which apps

* User get notify when Dev update apps
* Dev get notify when User report bugs or comment
* How can they colloborate,
